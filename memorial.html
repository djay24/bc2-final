      <p class="memorial-text">Dave Oester was a man who pursued many dreams in his life.
</br>
</br>
He was the leader of the International Ghost Hunter Society, inventor, Reiki master, spiritual teacher, self-published author and publisher, USMC veteran, explorer, accountant, wildcatter, minister, lecturer, and dowser.
</br>
</br>
Yet it was his last adventure that had the most tragic and final outcome.

Following the death of his beloved wife of 22 years in January 2014, Dave Oester worked to rebuild his life. He fell victim to Catfishing (an intentionally misleading romantic internet dating scheme) involving an international inheritance scam that would lead him over the course of a year and a half to his death.
</br>
</br>
Dave, thinking that he had found someone who would love, appreciate and need him, ended up selling his house and all his worldly possessions, liquidating his retirement savings and drawing funds from his personal credit cards to send to his new “soulmate,” who promised him they would be together as soon as she could pay for family medical bills and later they'd receive her families inheritance.
</br>
</br>
Dave died alone in a hostel, unable to pay for his diabetes medication or enough food to keep his body functioning and his family is grieving his loss and tragic end.

Dave was a living example that dreams are worth striving for even when there are those who would laugh or mock them. He was never afraid to try something new. He looked for ways to believe the impossible. He gave us all a great sense of adventure and the idea that there is more to this life than we are told.

We will never forget the impact he had on our lives, shaping us into the people we are today.

Dave is survived by his five children, Joanna Wilbur, Andrew Oester, David Oester, Sarah Thompson and Carolina Forni. As well as his two younger brothers, Richard and Steven Oester.</p>
